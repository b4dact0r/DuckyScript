This script will steal SSIDs and associated psaswords and store on drive d:

The file will be named (ComputerName)_(Date)_(Time)_Log.txt

This script will take a while to run as there's a lot of typing and it could definitely be improved.

Planned improvements: 

- Auto detect drive letter
- Move main commands in to .ps1 file
