This script requires you to store the stealfilesmac.sh file on your Ducky so you will need your Ducky set up as a twinduck

You will need to update the paths in the payload to match the name of your Ducky

The stealfilesmac.sh file is currently set to slurp all files but you can modify to slurp only certain types of files.  You 
can also modify the max size of files slurped and the folder depth but the defaults should be fairly sensible.
